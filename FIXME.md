# Fixme
This file is an informal collection of items to improve in the codebase meant
for the internal use of the maintainers. They are items that are:

* Either too trivial or not user-facing enough to be GitHub issues
* Too general or unrefined to be in the [ROADMAP][1] file
* Miscellaneous items that have yet to be sorted

----

* Add support for other options

[1]: ROADMAP.md "ROADMAP.md"
